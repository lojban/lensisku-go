### Chapter 2: Project Structure and Configuration Management
*   Designing a Go Project Layout: Best Practices for Scalable Applications
    *   Organizing Go packages (vs. Rust's `src/`, modules, and crates)
    *   Standard Go Project Layout (e.g., `/cmd`, `/pkg`, `/internal`)
    *   Managing shared vs. application-specific code
*   Configuration Management in Go
    *   Standard library approaches (e.g., `flag`, `os.Getenv`, JSON/YAML parsing)
    *   Popular third-party libraries (e.g., Viper, envconfig, koanf)
    *   Structured configuration using Go structs and tags
*   Translating `config.rs`:
    *   Handling environment variables securely
    *   Managing database connection strings and connection pool settings (e.g., `database/sql` pool)
    *   Application-specific configurations and feature flags
*   Dependency Management: Go Modules (`go.mod`, `go.sum`) vs. Rust's Cargo (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`)
*   Build Systems and Tooling: `go build`, `go test`, `go vet`, linters (e.g., `golangci-lint`), formatters (`gofmt`/`goimports`)

### Chapter 3: Robust Error Handling in Go
*   Go's `error` Interface: The Idiomatic Approach to Error Signaling
*   Translating Rust's `Result<T, E>` and Custom Error Enums/Structs (from `error.rs`):
    *   Creating custom error types in Go (structs implementing the `error` interface)
    *   Error wrapping for context (e.g., `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`)
    *   Distinguishing error types for programmatic handling
*   Error Handling Strategies: Returning errors vs. panicking (and recovering)
*   Centralized vs. Localized Error Handling and Logging
*   Integrating with logging libraries for structured error logs

## Part 2: Database Interaction and Business Logic

### Chapter 4: Database Operations with Go
*   Interfacing with Databases in Go: The `database/sql` Package
    *   Choosing and using database drivers (e.g., PostgreSQL with `pq` or `pgx`)

    *   Leveraging Goroutines and Channels for concurrent operations
    *   Synchronization primitives (Mutexes, WaitGroups) when needed

### Chapter 6: Translating Specific Business Logic Modules (Illustrative Examples)
    *   **Users & Authentication (`auth/`, `users/`, `auth_utils.rs`):**
        *   User model definition in Go (structs)
        *   CRUD operations for users (Repository pattern)
        *   Password hashing and management (e.g., `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`)
        *   Implementing authentication logic (token generation/validation, session management)
        *   Rust's `Auth` extractors/guards vs. Go middleware or context-based auth
    *   **Collections (`collections/`):**
        *   Defining collection and item structures in Go
        *   Logic for managing user-created collections (Service layer)
        *   Database interactions for collections
    *   **Comments (`comments/`):**
        *   Comment data structures and relationships
        *   Implementing comment creation, retrieval, updates, and moderation logic
    *   *Note: This chapter will detail these examples, and the principles can be applied to other modules like `flashcards`, `grammar`, `jbovlaste`, `language`, `export`, `versions`, etc. Each would involve defining Go structs, interfaces for services/repositories, and implementing the core logic, comparing with Rust's specific implementations (e.g., use of traits, specific libraries).*
